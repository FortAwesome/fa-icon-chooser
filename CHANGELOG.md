## [0.8.0](https://github.com/FortAwesome/fa-icon-chooser/releases/tag/0.8.0) - 2025-02-14

### Changed

- The `IconChooserResult` object emitted by the icon chooser's selection event may now include
  not only an `IconLookup` (the `name` and `prefix` of an icon in a particular familyStyle),
  but also an entire [`IconDefinition`](https://docs.fontawesome.com/apis/javascript/methods#findicondefinitionparams) (including the SVG path data).
  This allows for embedding SVG icons directly in content.

  Font Awesome Pro icons are subject to the terms of the [Font Awesome Pro license](https://fontawesome.com/license).
  This license is restricted for some plan types, such as Pro Lite. At the time of this release,
  the Pro Lite plan license does not permit embedding of Pro SVGs, except by the official
  Font Awesome WordPress plugin. See the [plans](https://fontawesome.com/plans) page and [support](https://fontawesome.com/support)
  page for details.

  The `fa-icon-chooser` queries the Font Awesome GraphQL API to determine whether the current user
  has permissions to embed Pro SVGs. If not, then the `IconChooserResult` will include only the
  `IconLookup` object, not the full `IconDefinition` object.

  Thus, a developer using this `fa-icon-chooser` need not write any business logic according to
  the current user's Font Awesome plan type. However, the developer should take care to handle
  either case in its UI. Do not assume that the `IconDefinition` is always present in the
  `IconChooserResult` object.

  Consider showing the user a message like: "Your current Font Awesome plan does not allow embedding SVG icons.
  You can upgrade to enable this feature."

- The `QueryHandler` type of the `handleQuery()` callback function now takes an optional third argument: `options`.
  That `options` object now has a single optional property: `cache`.
  When `cache` is `true`, the results of the `handleQuery()` function may be cached, and a cached
  result may be returned instead of a new query being sent to the GraphQL API.
  This allows the kit metadata query to be cached. A kit's metadata rarely changes, but it must be
  provided each time the icon chooser is mounted. Hence caching it allows for much quicker
  re-opening of the icon chooser after the first time it's opened.

  This `cache` option is not used when searching icons, only when loading the kit's metadata.

### Breaking Changes

- This release includes a major upgrade of `@stencil/core`, the library used to build this web component
  package. The new version of StencilJS requires a minimum version of React >= 17.
  So the `fa-icon-chooser-react` package in this repo now requires React >= 17.

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/FortAwesome/fa-icon-chooser/releases/tag/0.7.0) - 2024-06-05

### Changed

- Family and style selection are now based on drop down selections, and the available
  values are retrieved from the GraphQL API. This removes the hardcoding of familyStyles
  and lets the icon chooser work with all available familyStyles for the active version
  of Font Awesome.
- Several slots for messages to indicate the unavailability of certain familyStyles
  have been removed. They are no longer used, now that the UI only includes in
  the drop down selectors available familyStyle combinations for the active version
  of Font Awesome.

  The following slots have been removed:
  - `light-requires-pro`
  - `thin-requires-pro`
  - `duotone-requires-pro`
  - `sharp-solid-requires-pro`
  - `sharp-regular-requires-pro`
  - `sharp-light-requires-pro`
  - `uploaded-requires-pro`
  - `sharp-solid-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `sharp-regular-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `sharp-light-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `solid-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `regular-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `light-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `thin-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `duotone-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `brands-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `uploaded-style-filter-sr-message`

- The `QueryHandler` type now takes a second optional argument for variables.
  (See also Breaking Changes)o

### Fixed
- Duotone custom icons in kits now work correctly.

### Breaking Changes

- The icon chooser's queries now use variables, instead of interpolating all values
  into a single query document string. Thus, any `QueryHandler` callback must be updated
  to handle the query variables.

  Its type signature is now:

  ```typescript
  export type QueryHandler = (document: string, variables?: object) => Promise<any>;
  ```

  Suggestion:

  ```javascript
  async function handleQuery(query, variables) {
    const headers = buildHeaders()
    const url = getApiUrl()
    const body = JSON.stringify({query, variables})

    return fetch(url, {
      method: "POST",
      headers,
      body
    })
  }
  ```
