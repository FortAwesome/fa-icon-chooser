## [0.7.0](https://github.com/FortAwesome/fa-icon-chooser/releases/tag/0.7.0) - 2024-06-05

### Changed

- Family and style selection are now based on drop down selections, and the available
  values are retrieved from the GraphQL API. This removes the hardcoding of familyStyles
  and lets the icon chooser work with all available familyStyles for the active version
  of Font Awesome.
- Several slots for messages to indicate the unavailability of certain familyStyles
  have been removed. They are no longer used, now that the UI only includes in
  the drop down selectors available familyStyle combinations for the active version
  of Font Awesome.

  The following slots have been removed:
  - `light-requires-pro`
  - `thin-requires-pro`
  - `duotone-requires-pro`
  - `sharp-solid-requires-pro`
  - `sharp-regular-requires-pro`
  - `sharp-light-requires-pro`
  - `uploaded-requires-pro`
  - `sharp-solid-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `sharp-regular-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `sharp-light-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `solid-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `regular-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `light-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `thin-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `duotone-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `brands-style-filter-sr-message`
  - `uploaded-style-filter-sr-message`

- The `QueryHandler` type now takes a second optional argument for variables.
  (See also Breaking Changes)o

### Fixed
- Duotone custom icons in kits now work correctly.

### Breaking Changes

- The icon chooser's queries now use variables, instead of interpolating all values
  into a single query document string. Thus, any `QueryHandler` callback must be updated
  to handle the query variables.

  Its type signature is now:

  ```typescript
  export type QueryHandler = (document: string, variables?: object) => Promise<any>;
  ```

  Suggestion:

  ```javascript
  async function handleQuery(query, variables) {
    const headers = buildHeaders()
    const url = getApiUrl()
    const body = JSON.stringify({query, variables})

    return fetch(url, {
      method: "POST",
      headers,
      body
    })
  }
  ```
